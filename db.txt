					***** NANAGA PARBAT ******
Nanga Parbat massif is the western corner pillar of the Himalayas. It is an isolated range of peaks just springing up from nothing and is surrounded by the rivers Indus and Astore. Nanga Parbat or "Nanga Parvata" means the naked mountain. It’s original and appropriate name, however, is Diamir the “King Of The Mountains”.

Nanga Parbat (main peak) has a height of 8126 meters/26,660 ft. It has three vast faces. The Rakhiot (Ra Kot) face is dominated by the north and south silver crags and silver plateau. The Diamir face is rocky in the beginning. It converts itself into ice fields around the higher end of the peak. The Rupal face is the highest precipice in the world. Reinhold Messner, a living legend in mountaineering from Italy has said “every one who has ever stood at the foot of this face (4500 meters) up above the 'Tap Alpe'; studied it or flown over it, could not help but have been amazed by its sheer size. Nanga Parbat is indisputably the highest rock and ice wall in the world!

			Gasherbrum 1

Gasherbrum means a shining wall. There are six Gasherbrum peaks in the Karakorum Baltoro Range. It was captain Young husband and his party, which in 1889 discovered Gasherbrum glacier. American Geologist-cum-climber and winner of the 1936 Olympic Gold Medal visited the area and after doing some photographic work on the Baltoro glacier, made an attempt on the southeast ridge of Gasherbrum-I, who is also called Hidden Peak (8068m in1935, Dr. P.C. Visser, a Dutch, and his party surveyed Gasherbrum glacier. It was, however, in 1936 that a strong French expedition led by H. de Segogne tried its luck on Gasherbrum-I. The party went up to 6,797m where camp-V was established. Subsequently the party located a place for camp-VI at 7,010m. it was however, due to a continuous storm and bad weather that the party was forced to abandon its plan. It was however, an American expedition of Nick Clinch, which in 1958 climbed Gasherbrum-I peak. Schoening and Kaufman went to its top. Nick was the first prison who crossed Masherbum La in 1974, much to the surprise of the villagers of Hushe, who thought their valley impregnable from the north. They remembered Clinch and gave him a warm welcome.

				**** BROAD PEAK *****
				BROAD PEAK

Broad Peak is one of the huge mountains which towers above Concordia at the heart of the Karakoram range. It lies on the Pakistani/Chinese frontier between K2 and the Gasherbrum peaks and was first climbed by an Austrian group in 1957, which included Kurt Diemberger and Herman Buhl.

Expeditions to Broad Peak start with a spectacular trek to base camp passing some of the most breath taking scenery in the Karakoram. The climb itself is more challenging than nearby Gasherbrum II. We climb the peak by the 'classic' West Ridge route that rises directly above base camp on the Godwin Austen glacier. The route follows a 30-45 degree snow slope with short rock sections. Three or Four camps will be placed and ropes will be fixed on the steeper sections of the climb. It is an excellent and exciting challenge for a mid-level as well as a senior level mountaineer

				TRANGO TOWER

Great Trango Tower is one of the most spectacular granite towers in the world; a dream come true for ardent rock climbers. We climb a very straight forward and technically moderate route up the north face from our base camp on the Dunge Glacier. Our trip begins in Islamabad and then onwards by private bus along the Karakoram highway to Skardu. From here we travel via Sport Utility Vehicles and/or jeeps into Askole where we start the 7-day trek into our base camp below Uli Biaho and the Trango Towers. A fascinating and mesmerizing place with huge granite rock towers reaching thousands of feet high, dropping down to the churning moraine of the Dunge and Trango glaciers. A trek up towards Concordia, near K2 base camp helps us acclimatize for the climb.
